Design document

I chose the ikea website because I thought it was a very sleek design and something i would like to make in the futurer
I chose the homepage and the green friday page because the homepage was require and the green friday was one of the only pages in the navigation bar that was an actual page and not a popup
For the componenets i chose the navigation directory, searchbar, and article template, navigation icons, as well as the logo that also worked as a navigation link. 
These coponenets did not change frome page to page so i made them as they were used many times, and also had good reusability when it comes to other webistes as they are common components.
